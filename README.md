# eventStream
This library is designed to make serial communications between Arduino's much easier. This library was originally designed to make communication using XBee's much easier but there are no restrictions to using it for any serial communcation. It includes a simple checksum to weed out bad messages and a number of utilities to make it easy to send and receive information.
